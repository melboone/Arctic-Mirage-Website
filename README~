# The Arctic Mirage Website #

## Website offer ##
- 1 main page + 3 additional pages
- make the page as seo friendly as possible (images, links, meta's, etc - excluding text)
- with everything that you said: images rearranging, slides, etc ...

= $600 ($110 discount for your new website)

-- because there are so many projects there (18 as i could count and maybe more in the future    ), the best thing would be to make a CMS based website but that might be an overkill as i don't think you really need the complications of updates, extra security, admin pages, etc .. so static pages might be the way to go for you.
-- if you agree with this, i would charge $17 ($3 discount) for extra page there and every new page that will be added there in the future (new thumbnail on the main page + full page for that project)
